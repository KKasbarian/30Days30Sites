## Day 28: Digital Agency

This site is again one of the best sites that I have ever made, it resembles a fake digital agency, with as much cool effects, animations and under-the-hood magic as possible. It is branded and copyrighted by Me (the logo, favicon, brand etc). :D

I won't write about all the helpful resources that I used for this site here, I'll only tell the structure of the site as I always did with the previous sites.

A cool banner which probably represents the agency with a good navbar on small and Desktop devices, cool-placed text and CTA on big devices, but normally-placed on small devices.

About section which introduces the company and an image which represents the company.

The services section is about all the services that the agency has to offer with detailed info.

A small customers section with logos of the brands and customers. Then, a Flexbox powered projects section with cool effects and stuff!!

A clean Our Team section introduces the team with simple and minimal, yet a cool way. It's followed by a good contact section, which, by the way, has a hidden form, which is displayed upon clicking the Email Us button.

Finally, a simple footer section.
