## Day 8: Celebrity Page

This was really Fun and Challenging to Build. There were a lot Going On Here:
- Flexbox Navigation for First Time.
- Interesting Navigation Tweaks on Mobile Version.
- CSS Transition and Animation Basics Implemented.
- Flexbox Used in Most of the Sections.
- Gave Credit to All Images Respectively :)
- Added a Responsive Gallery SlideShow.
- Made a Huge and Responsive Table and Gave some Style to it.

Planning to make the Navigation Bar Stick to the Top when Scrolled and Redesigning the Footer to make it look Better with the Design of the Page Soon.
