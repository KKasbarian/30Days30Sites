## Day 20: Blog

I wanted to make the blog my personal or for a sport related blog, but as the challenge required it to be about travelling, lifestyle and parenthood, I made it as the PSD layout was suggested.

It turned out to be so cool, with the fonts, colors and accents.

Usual sticky navigation for big and small devices at the top. A big banner which is related to the top story below it, where you can check an actual article by clicking Read More.

An awesome Latest Posts section interrupted by a newsletter section and other posts continue below it. You can also click the Load More button to load more articles (What!! Awesome!!!). And a minmal footer section at the bottom.

The article page is similar to the home blog page in terms of colors, fonts, accents and overall layouts as suggested in the PSD file. Usual article texts and images, but the cool thing was the sharing options, great-looking Related section and, finally, hardly-done Comments section, which is better on a big screen.
