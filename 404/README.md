## Day 30: 404 Page

A simple 404 page with minimal content, simple navigation bar, an explanation text, input and a CTA Home button. That's it. As I said, a simple 404 page, done in less than 2 hours. Fully (and I hope fully) responsive site. Used some Flexbox here and there.

By the way, it's the third site that I used CSS Grid in it.
