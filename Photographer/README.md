## Day 10: Photographer

I wanted to Make this Site a Template and not just a Normal Site again. The Thing is, I Fell in Love with this Template (Site), Because, IMO, It's So S**y (Not the Pictures, the Site :D ).

I did a lot of Interesting Things Here:
- Made 2 Navigation Bars, One for Small and One for Medium and Big Screens.
- Fixed Body Bakground, which is Really Soothing!! (Idea Implemented from another Template Site from a Random Site (Unfortunately, I can't Remember where that Template is).
- Parallax Effect used for Good.
- Flexbox as Always is Used a Lot.
- Gallery Section's Design is taken from W3Schools.
- I can't Beleive I made a Map and a Contact Form Aligned beside Each Other!!
- I Implemented a Map.
- Interesting Footer.

PS: I want to turn this into a Paid Template because I really Love it, but Not Sure Yet!!! xD
