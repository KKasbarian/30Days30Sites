## Day 18: Cruise Ship

I didn't do a lot on this one actually, but it took me lot of hours to get this done.

I made a 2 layered navigation bars with the sign in/register option being a dropdown on big screens, but on mobile I made a good looking navbar.

I borrowed a simple slideshow from W3.CSS from W3Schools for the banner.

I made the About and Excursions section responsive with Flexbox (as always), putting a parallax banner in between for big screens.

Made a fake ad section, also to credit to the makers of the cruiseship logo for the navbar. Usual contact us section and a really cool footer.
