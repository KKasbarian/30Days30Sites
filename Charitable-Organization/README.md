## Day 16: Charitable Organization

I did a lot on this one actually.

I tried to make a good banner. Used Flexbox almost everywhere. The pictures sizes are different, so they are bigger/smaller than other pics.

I wanted to be a bit creative with the Donation section, the form, Donators Board, a map etc. (I'm not sure if I was actually creative, but hopefully). Many things to choose on the form and a Donators Board added a bit of a functionality there too.
