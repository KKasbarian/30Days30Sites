## Day 19: Candy

I made a really cool looking site for KitKat, because, who doesn't love it!! I really wanted to make it close to the PSD which was provided with the challenge.

I, finally, for the first time, managed to make an absolutely floated section (which I'm really proud of), but it has a small disadvantage though, soo small (go to the bottom of the page, change the viewport of the browser slowly to make it smaller and you'll see what's the issue with the layer underneath the floated section).

I made a cool navigation bar at the top and in the floating section, which is also cool looking on smaller devices too.

The banner is so delicious, the KitKat Cup and the text combination made it even more delicious.

I made the About section with the "columns" property in CSS as I newly read about it, which is cool by the way for book, magazine or newspaper-like text layouts (not for overall layouts though).

Our Open Hours and Video section was interesting to make. Flexbox-powered (as always!) Categories section and a cool parallax banner at the bottom gave a cool taste to the site.

Finally, an usual Socials section and a simple footer finalised the making of a KitKat Cup.
