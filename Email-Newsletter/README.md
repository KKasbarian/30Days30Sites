## Day 21: Email Newsletter

I didn't do much on this one, no hard layout designs, I wanted to make it as simple for a newsletter as possible.

Top banner to view the email in a browser (If we're in an email app!). Title section with the logo (Made by Me!) and the edition.

The first post is the top trending post, then comes the latest posts which are made with Flexbox.

About section to introduce the newsletter and a Sponsored section, becaue, pretty much every email has a sponsored section, correct, right? Yep.

Usual footer-like info, unsubscribe, FAQ etc. section at the bottom of the newsletter.
