## Day 23: Gardener

I built this site with mostly green colors but with different shades, but it turned out to be good.

I made the usual navigation bars, banner with a big CTA, another banner, but for a quote related to the topic.

I made a small section about the About Us info and then explained what they do in 3 big categories (made by Flexbox, of course!).

The Works section contains some work done by the organization and the other section is just a clean looking form to participate for one of the services etc.

Finally, a usual footer to sum up with company info and copyright info.
