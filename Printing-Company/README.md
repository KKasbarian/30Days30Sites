## Day 14: Printing Company

This was one of the longest sites that took me forever to complete, 1.5 week to be honest because, life is hard and the content of the site is a lot!

I used a lot of flexbox, made an interesting navigation section at top with 3 layers (Logo and Important Sections, Search and Actual Navbar).

There are lot of section, I mean, for me, A lot. I tried some not-so-cool color combination, but it turned out to be not so bad after all. Body background is a texture image.


The About Section and Footer are so cool, especially the Footer!
