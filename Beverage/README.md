## Day 13: Beverage

An Interesting Site I built.

Few things to Mention that I did:
- Added a top Useless, but Support Banner.
- Interesting Navigation Design on Big Screens.
- 2 Different Navigation Bars for Small and Big Screens.
- Flexbox was Used a Lot.
- Greenish Accent Color Used, which is Good as the Logo is Green Too.
- I made a really Stunning thing to the Contact Form on Big Screens, so you should Check it!!
