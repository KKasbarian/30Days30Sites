## Day 17: Fashion/Clothes Site

This is one of the best sites I've built so far.

The Content is rich, I made a Fake Brand, picked an accent color, Images are handpicked (don't get too excited for the images :D).

A Hot Navbar with an awesome banner below it, which is a video actually (I couldn't make it as a background, so I used the <video> tag instead).

I loved the sample site's color choosing for clothes and wearings, so I made a colorful one for mine.

The Trending and Gift Cards Sections were cool too. I also made a good looking Locations and Newsletter Sections.

Your Orders could function whenever a user is signed in, which, in this case, couldn't be done, so a banner is there.

Overall, this site is so Hot, I really liked the output.

I want to change the Your Orders section's options to extend to full width and adding border-top to the footer sometimes not-so-soon.
