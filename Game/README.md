## Day 26: Game's Official Site

A simple site that introduces FIFA 17. All the needed sections are here.

Cool navbar on small and Desktop devices. A big banner with a CTA button. Some text which gives some info about the game.

A Flexbox powered features section which tells about good features and abilities of the game. After that an iframe about the trailer of the game.

There is a buy and newsletter section, which we know for what they are meant, obviously!! And finally, a simple footer.
