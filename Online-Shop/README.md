## Day 24: Online Shop

This was the second time that I used CSS Grid and it was awesome and challenging.

Made a cool navigation bar with banners of main news, then the features of the site, all with Flexbox (probably).

I arranged the Filter section and shopping items section with CSS Grid.

A simple newsletter and back to top full width button before a good footer to finish up the site.
