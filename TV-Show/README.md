## Day 27: TV Show

I made a site about Rick & Morty. The usual navigation bar on small and Desktop devices, followed by a banner (or I would say, a poster).

An about and videos section to know more about the show. A Flexbox powered crew and news section, followed by a newsletter.

Finally, a footer, which is a bit different, it's about the timing of the show on the mentioned two channels or services.

The only experiment on this site was the use of the curved line with :before or :after after the crew section, which turned out to be not-that-cool, but it was good to try for the first time myself.
