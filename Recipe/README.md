## Day 25: Recipe

I tried to make this site as minimal, cool and delicious as possible, with an awesome layout, color accents and combinations.

Made a cool looking navigation bar at the top on Desktop devices, but a usual navbar for small devices is there. Then a banner with a CTA button.

Latest section is done with Flexbox arranged items, with one sponsored item in between for promotion etc. The list is interrupted with a newsletter section.

Then comes a big list with the most popular items, again arranged with Flexbox. A small section at last about the latest posts on Instagram for this site, followed by a minimal footer.
